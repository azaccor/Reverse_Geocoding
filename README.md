# Reverse_Geocoding
The original intention of this script was to identify survey taker's zipcodes based on IP address so that we could infer demographic data.
While the code works, we ended up abandoning the project because where they took the survey was not necessarily their home.
For example, we found one in Morelos Mexico before we realized that this was not necessarily the data we were after. Live and learn.
